How to Install the Game

The project is run in VSCode.

First, you need to set up a virtual environment:

Install Python (if it’s not already installed): Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: 

```https://www.python.org/```

Install virtualenv (if it’s not already installed): virtualenv is a tool for creating virtual environments. If it’s not installed, run the following command:

```pip install virtualenv```

Create a virtual environment: Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```python -m venv venv```

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

On macOS/Linux:

```source venv/bin/activate```

After activating the virtual environment, install the Panda3D library:

```pip install panda3d```

Restart VSCode and don’t forget to activate the virtual environment again.

```Run the game.py file.```
